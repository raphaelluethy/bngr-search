# bngr Search

Use bngr to use bangs with your search engine of choice. This Raycast extension allows you to quickly search using bngr.ch.

## Usage

The extension provides two main actions:

-   **Search with Bngr:** Opens the search query directly on bngr.ch using the default search.
-   **Pipe Search to Default Search:**  Opens the search query on bngr.ch, piping the search to the default search engine specified on the site.  This can be triggered with `Cmd + Return`.

You can also find more information and configure your default search engine on [bngr.ch](https://bngr.ch).
